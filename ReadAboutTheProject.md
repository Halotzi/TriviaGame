# TriviaGame
My first database project! ðŸ’­

During the last semester, I created trivia game based on MySQL on Unity.
At each stage, additional questions and categories can be added to the database and they will automatically be added to the game.

Of course, at the end of each game, the player is registered on the leaderboard so... answer as many questions correctly as possible!
